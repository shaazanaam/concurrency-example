The concurrency is the execution of several tasks simultaneously and is used to omprove through put ( by using several processors for a 
 single computation ) or to improve responsiveness( By allowing one part of a program to progress while the other is waiting for the 
 responsiveness
 
 the one provided by the standard library directly supports the concurrent execution of multiple threads in a single address space .
 C++ allow a suitable memory model and a set of atomic operations . However most users will see concurrency only in terms of the standards library built on top of that 
 The main standard library concurrency support facilites are 
 1. threads mutexes lock() operations, packaged_tasks and futures
 these features are built directly upon what operating systems offer and do not incur performance penalties compared with those.


 A computation that can potentially be executed concurrently with other computations is a task. A thread is a system level 
 representation of a task in a program . A task to be executed concurrently with other tasks is launched by the constructing a 
 std::thread ( found in <thread>) with the task as its argument . A task is a function or a function object
