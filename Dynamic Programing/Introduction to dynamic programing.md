Programing means planning and taking the decision and how do you take the decision and its related to the linear programming .Linear programing has a straigt and linear approach. You have to see it from different perspectives . 

They usually deal with the optimization problems and it depends on the Min /Max.
Dynamic programing is the technique used to solve the problems which has one single solutions which is the optimation problem

.. if a problem p is given which is an optimation problem it will have the objective which is Max or the Min and also it will have some constrains and the solution should be satisfying some constrains and we need a maximum solution and suppose there is  a problem P and there may be many problem S1 S2 S3 and so On Sk   .. Some of these solutioons are going to be satisfying the constrains and some them might be optimal and which is the optimal solution so its an objective and optimation problem and one of the approach is the Greedy Method which is the Dynamic Programing . 

Greedy method has shown some selection procedure and takes us to the optimal solution ., It tells us to select something in the input and then approach the problem in that manner  to generate the solution 

How can you say the particular solution is  the optimal solution . You can only say that when you have checked all the possible solutions  

Greedy method is also taking us to the optimal solution .
Dynamic Programing tries to find out all the possible solution and then compare then and generate the optimal problem.

when you dont have the selection procedure the you go for the dynamic program.

Dynamic program tells us to do the faster way of doing this . and it will try to discard a bunch of solution and indirectly it will be  checking all the possible solutions.

In dynamic programming you will have to make decisions if the solution is an optimal or not and there will be decison at every step and there will be a sequence of decision and the sequene  of the decison will be giving you the result
#  PRINCIPLE OF OPTIMALITY
result will be optimal if the decision is optimal and in each step you select the input and the way you select the input will depend on the problem.

Dynamic programing prepares the data and from that it will take the decison from a tabulazied data and it will be genreating the tabular data and the
